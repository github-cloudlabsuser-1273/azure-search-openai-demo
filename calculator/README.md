# Futuristic Calculator

This is a Python project featuring a futuristic calculator with a Qt-based GUI. It supports basic, scientific, and advanced mathematical operations, and is designed with a modern, visually appealing interface.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Scientific functions (trigonometry, logarithms, exponentials)
- Advanced math (roots, powers, factorial, constants like Ï€ and e)
- Futuristic, modern UI using PyQt5 or PySide6
- Modular, extensible codebase

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: Entry point for the application
- `ui/`: UI components and styles
- `calculator/`: Core logic and mathematical operations

## Customization
You can extend the calculator by adding new modules in the `calculator/` directory and updating the UI accordingly.
